# Porting Korenvliet to C64

Why? I needed a project and this is one of the first games I ever completed.

Thanks to brilliant people on:

I can relive my first steps in IT: Programming in BASIC on a P2000T and using Basicode2/3 'beeldkrant' to write a 'werkstuk'.

And remembering having fun soldering the interface needed to read the radio broadcast from cassette tape into the computer.
